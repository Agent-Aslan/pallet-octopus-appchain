## Completed

We have been authorized a grant by the NEAR Grants Committee to further develop our hybrid-quantum technology, the Hypercube Algorithmic Language Oracle (HALO) which can be found at https://haloai.me, with the NEAR protocol. Thus far, we have set up our primary substrate on HALO's WSL Ubuntu with the intention of developing a Municiple Art Registry for the City of Alameda CA. 

## In Progress

HALO being the core substrate, it is capable of delivering an unlimited number of consumer-grade applications to the Octopus blockchain. For example, our XPRIZE submission (https://haloai.me/model) for Covid-19 predictions utelized HALO's data to create an ensemble of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) machine learning algorithms. Individuals and municipalities interested in running the algorithm for their city can pay NEAR to run the algorithm, which would be processed by the Octopus substrate. As another example, we are developing a decentralized rideshare application, which would work on the municipal level (see https://drivers.coop/ - we've had an initial meeting with them), and Octopus substrate can be the backbone of this with HALO providing the algorithm for the dApp and NEAR being the cryptocurrency used. Also, Transtopia will be an interactive gaming enviornment utilzing brain wave and other biofrequencies to help individuals achieve transformative states of mind that would normally take years of meditation practice. It would be powered by the NEAR platform.
